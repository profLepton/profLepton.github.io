Hey, nice to meet you! I love messing around with transformers and machine learning. I'm keeping this blog to document my findings and share them with the world. I hope you find something useful here.
I'm currently working on a multitude of projects personally, and I keep irrergularly posting here, so feel free to talk to me about anything that you find interesting!
